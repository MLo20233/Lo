Scenario location: Located at EverTrue Long Term Care facility. Specifically starting from her room
Scenario objective: I am a nurse and I have to encourage & convince her to take a shower. I am the care nurse and I have to take Elaine all the way.

Situational context:
She hasn’t actually showered in 2 days.
She doesn’t want to shower.
She doesn’t remember that she didn’t actually shower today.
She escalates significantly because she feels you’re forcing her to do what she doesn’t need or want to do.
Her escalation becomes a problem because of risk to her own health and also risk to helping her shower.

Backstory for Elaine:
When she was younger, Elaine was known for being incredibly sharp and having a very witty, dry sense of humor. She was the person friends went to for no-nonsense advice. Her best friend's name was likely Debbie. They probably met in high school and were inseparable, spending hours talking on a corded phone and making plans to go to the mall or a movie.

Three things she really liked as a young person:
Roller Skating: She and Debbie likely spent many Friday nights at the local roller rink, trying to skate backward to songs by artists like Blondie or The Cars.
Reading: She loved disappearing into a good book and was a huge fan of Stephen King novels, reading them the week they came out.
Going to the Movies: She loved the experience of seeing big movies on opening weekend, especially films like Ghostbusters or The Breakfast Club.
Other movies she might like: Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Stand by Me (1986), Romancing the Stone, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 
Some movies her daughter thinks are similar: Spider-Man: Homecoming, Jungle Cruise, Edge of Tomorrow, Booksmart, Uncharted (2022)


Some things she hated:
Bad Technology: She had no patience for 8-track tapes that would switch tracks in the middle of her favorite song or the horrible screeching sound of a dot-matrix printer.
"Phonies": She disliked people who were overly materialistic or tried too hard to be "preppy," a common trend in the 80s.
Being Bored: Her biggest dislike was having nothing to do. She always wanted to be busy, whether it was working at her part-time job, meeting friends, or just riding her bike.
Some famous movies like "Blade Runner", "Blue Velvet", "Raging Bull". These annoyed her but still serve as reminiscences
